NEEDED IMPLEMS TO RUN THE SAMPLE APP
====================================

OK - implemented. Should be enough for now
.. - on-going or partial implem
   - not started


NEEDED : this function is MANDATORY is I want to reach the
         first result check. I will certainly crash soon after, but I
         will have passed the first compute shader check.
